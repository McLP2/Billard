# Billard
This project was part of school. We had to create a "Billard Game"
with two circles moving left to right. I didn't read the task and created this.

Features:
* Accurate physics simulation
* Easily hackable multiplayer
* Slow graphics
* Simplified, undocumented rules
* Crappy chat
* Difficult to play
* Non-responsive design 
* Ugly multilingual code

I will probably not continue developement.
